# UI RESTful Services

This app provides RESTful services to the UI.  All of the pinging of services happens in this app, and the result of which is provided to the UI.

## Services Definition

Currently, there's a ```server-status.json``` file that defines all of the services to be checked.  This may or may not be a good idea.

## To build this app

```bash
./build.sh
```
