# ui directory

This is a simple Angular app intended to provide a dashboard showing the status of Tomcat apps in all test environments.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.3.1.

## Faux Backend

Run ```start-data-server.sh``` then ```start-ui.sh```.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## To build this ui

```bash
./build.sh
```

The result of this build will be a ```.jar``` file which is then packaged with the application.
